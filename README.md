## Installation

### Setting Up a Virtual Environment
To avoid conflicts with other Python projects you might be working on, it's a good idea to use a virtual environment. Here's how to set one up:

```bash
# Install virtualenv if you haven't already
pip install virtualenv

# Create a virtual environment
virtualenv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# Linux or macOS
source venv/bin/activate

# Install Jupyter Notebook if you haven't already
pip install notebook
```

## Running

```bash
# Launch Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook ml_screen.ipynb
```

Then, follow the notebook.
